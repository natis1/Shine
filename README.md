# Shine

##### Solaris Husk Intelligence

Coming soon...

### What will this be?

Shine will be a tie-in software to the Ascension of the Moths series which will provide rocket AI to Kerbal Space Program.
It will be built on top of kRPC, and modular enough to be adapted to any system, including other games and real life rockets.
